My current research interests lie in the areas of security and privacy issues in the software supply chain, mobile systems, and IoT systems. I am dedicated to uncovering new attack vectors and identifying emerging privacy issues in these domains. My approach utilizes reverse engineering, static and dynamic analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and formal verification techniques to detect, measure, and safeguard against these newly identified security and privacy vulnerabilities.
